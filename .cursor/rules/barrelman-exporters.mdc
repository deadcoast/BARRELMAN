# BARRELMAN Export Systems

BARRELMAN provides multiple export and preview systems to visualize and share BARRELMAN language files in different formats.

## HTML Exporter

Located in `src/exporters/html_exporter.py`

- Converts BARRELMAN tokens to syntax-highlighted HTML
- Supports dark mode and light mode themes
- Creates standalone HTML files that can be viewed in any browser
- Used by the preview server for web-based visualization

## Markdown Exporter

Located in `src/exporters/markdown_exporter.py`

- Generates markdown representation of BARRELMAN syntax
- Creates human-readable text with appropriate formatting
- Useful for documentation and sharing in text-based contexts
- Preserves syntax structure with markdown formatting

## GraphViz DOT Exporter

Located in `src/exporters/graphviz/dot_exporter.py`

- Creates graph visualization files in DOT format
- Represents the hierarchical structure of BARRELMAN code
- Can be processed with GraphViz tools to create visual diagrams
- Useful for understanding complex BARRELMAN structures

## Preview Server

Located in `src/preview_server.py`

- Flask-based web server for interactive viewing
- Provides live syntax-highlighted rendering in a browser
- Serves static assets from the `src/static` directory
- Uses a compact HTML template for rendering
- Accessible at http://localhost:5000 when running

## Usage

All exporters can be accessed through the CLI:

```
python -m src.main <file.bman> [--html] [--markdown] [--dot] [--preview] [--dark-mode]
```

- `--html`: Generate HTML export
- `--markdown`: Generate Markdown export
- `--dot`: Generate GraphViz DOT export
- `--preview`: Start live preview server
- `--dark-mode`: Use dark theme for HTML output

## Integration

The export systems are designed to work with the token structure produced by the `BarrelmanLexer`. The exporters process the token list to generate formatted output in their respective formats.
