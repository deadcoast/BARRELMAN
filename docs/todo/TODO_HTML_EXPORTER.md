1. Implement HTML escaping for token content to prevent XSS vulnerabilities by using a function like `html.escape()`.
2. Use a context manager (e.g., `with open(...) as f:`) to ensure the file is properly closed after writing.
3. Consider using a templating engine (e.g., Jinja2) for better separation of HTML structure and Python logic, improving maintainability.
4. Add error handling to manage file writing exceptions and invalid token inputs.
5. Include an option to customize the HTML template for better styling flexibility.
6. Implement a progress indicator for large token lists to enhance user experience.
